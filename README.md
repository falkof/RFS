# RFS
Detecting Refeeding Syndrome (RFS) using ML/AI

## Summary

An early warning system intended to highlight the risk of RFS patients. This development is meant to minimize further risks of incorrect treatment/nutrition, It provides an easy-to-use support for those who are unsure. Helping patients and the community of medical spialists or professionals. 

## Background

Hospitals and specialized medical practices see these symptoms quite often. 

My personal motivation is to contribute with newly acquired knowledge in IT and software development in a value-added way. In the same time I want to support my partner in her work. She herself works in oncology and palliative care and has also observed refeeding syndrome in real life.

## How is it used?

I'm planning to release a website and/or an app, free to use and contribute. The relevant laboratory values ​​(over a period of x days) are entered and with those a final result can be computed.
Users will be medical professionals. Laboratory values (of real human patients) are required. 

## Data sources and AI methods

One idea is to first consider all factors using traditional assessment methods (and conventional programming). This will then allow medical professionals to evaluate whether the calculation worked correctly or not. At the same time, the new dataset can be incorporated into the data collection and consequently improve the results.

## Challenges

The biggest challenges currently are collecting reliable data and handling everything in compliance with data protection regulations.
Further future challanges could be spamming bots, in case this will be opened widely.

## What next?

Right now I'm planning the software design (and looking deeper in AI functionality). Everyone is invited to reach out who is either facing same difficulties or wanting to contribute.

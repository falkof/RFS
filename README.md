# RFS
Detecting Refeeding Syndrome (RFS) using ML/AI

An early warning system is intended to highlight the risk of RFS and mitigate further risks of incorrect treatment/nutrition.

The biggest challenges currently are collecting reliable data and handling everything in compliance with data protection regulations.

One idea is to first consider all factors using traditional assessment methods (and conventional programming). This will then allow medical professionals to evaluate whether the calculation worked correctly or not. At the same time, the new dataset can be incorporated into the data collection and consequently improve the results.
